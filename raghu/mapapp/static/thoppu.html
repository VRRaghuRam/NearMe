                Shenbaga Thoppu, a forest area about 8 km west from Srivilliputtur, is an excellent option for trekking. Though there is no proper bus service to reach here, the place can be accessed by two-wheeler or even by cycle.

The forests are situated on the eastern slopes of the Western Ghats, with only 6.3% of the total geographical area under forest cover. The mountain slopes are home to many rare and endemic varieties of flora and fauna. Established in 1989, the Shenbagathoppu Wildlife Sanctuary spans 480 square kilometers and is located in Srivilliputtur taluk. The sanctuary is contiguous with the Periyar Tiger Reserve to the southwest and the Megamalai Reserve Forest to the northwest, with altitudes ranging from 100 to 2010 meters above sea level. It is also known for protecting the endangered Grizzled Giant Squirrel (Ratufa macrora), an arboreal species.
